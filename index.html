    const message = `You are never too far to return to Allah.

Read this short duʿāʾ for forgiveness, and then forward it to 5 people to earn ongoing reward and du'ā.
Pause for a moment, turn your heart toward Allah, and read the following duʿā sincerely.

Niyyah:

I intend this recitation of this du'a for myself, the compilers, the sharers, and the recipients. 

The Duʿāʾ:

Ya Allah (O Allah), Ya Dhul-Maghfirah (O Possessor of Forgiveness), Ya Ghāfūr (O Most Forgiving), Ya Ghaffār (O Perpetual Forgiver), Ya Tawwāb (O Accepter of Repentance) — we repent to You and ask You for complete forgiveness for all the sins we committed in the past and those we may commit in the future, from what we have done in private and what we did in the open, and all that You know better than we do.

Because of the niyyah, when others recite this after you share it, you are included in their duʿāʾ. They will be praying for your forgiveness too.
This is 1 of 23 supplications from The Supplication of Infinite Blessings.

Take a few seconds now and forward this to at least 5 people — so the reward of spreading goodness increases for you, and duʿāʾs continue to be made for you with every sincere recitation.
