// === Dua 1 message (keep this exact text) ===
const message = `*You’re not too far to come back to Allah*

This powerful dua calls upon Allah ﷻ — by His Names Dhul-Maghfirah (Possessor of Forgiveness), Al-Ghafūr (The Most Forgiving), Al-Ghaffār (The Constant Forgiver), and At-Tawwāb (The Accepter of Repentance) — to forgive every sin, whether public or private, past or future.

Because no matter how far you’ve fallen, Allah’s door is always open.

As Rasulullah ﷺ said:

"Every son of Adam sins, and the best of those who sin are those who repent." 

*Ya Allah (O Allah), Ya Dhul-Maghfirah (O Possessor of Forgiveness), Ya Ghāfūr (O Most Forgiving), Ya Ghaffār (O Perpetual Forgiver), Ya Tawwāb (O Acceptor of Repentance), we repent to You and ask You for complete forgiveness for all the sins we committed in the past and those we may commit in the future, from what we have done in private and what we did in the open, and all that You know better than we do.*

This dua is part of *The Supplication of Infinite Blessings* — a powerful collection of heartfelt supplications designed to benefit you in both this life and the next. 

*At Dua Sharing, our mission is simple*: 

To encourage sincere dua, meaningful sharing, and to multiply blessings through a growing global chain of people making dua for one another every single day.

As Rasulullah ﷺ said: 

“The supplication of a Muslim for his brother in his absence will certainly be answered. Every time he makes a supplication for good for his brother, the angel appointed for this task says: ‘Ameen! And may it be for you too.”

Every post we share is taken directly from the full Supplication of Infinite Blessings — with the aim of moving hearts, inspiring action, and reminding us all of what truly matters.

Access the full supplication in both English and Arabic at: https://www.duasharing.com

When you share this post, you’re not simply sharing a dua. You’re opening the door to millions of people making sincere dua for you — with the Malaika (Angels) themselves saying “Ameen” to every single one.

May Allah accept it from you, and from everyone it reaches through you.

Ameen`;
