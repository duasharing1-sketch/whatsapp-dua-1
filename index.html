This powerful duʿāʾ calls upon Allah ﷻ — by His Names: Dhul-Maghfirah, Al-Ghafūr, Al-Ghaffār and At-Tawwāb — to forgive every sin, whether public or private, past or future.

*The Duʿāʾ:*  

Ya Allah (O Allah), Ya Dhul-Maghfirah (O Possessor of Forgiveness), Ya Ghāfūr (O Most Forgiving), Ya Ghaffār (O Perpetual Forgiver), Ya Tawwāb (O Accepter of Repentance), we repent to You and ask You for complete forgiveness for all the sins we committed in the past and those we may commit in the future, from what we have done in private and what we did in the open, and all that You know better than we do.

This duʿāʾ is part of the *Supplication of Infinite Blessings* — a growing chain of heartfelt duʿāʾs shared by countless believers like you, worldwide.

And because in an authentic hadith reported by Muʿādh ibn Anas (ra), Rasulullah ﷺ encouraged us to share beneficial knowledge, I humbly ask that you please forward this message far and wide — it only takes a few seconds, and your sharing can start a chain of duʿāʾs that continue returning to you from everyone it reaches.

When you share this message, you’re not simply sharing a duʿāʾ. You’re opening the door to countless people making sincere duʿāʾ for you daily — with the Malaika (Angels) themselves saying *“Ameen”* to every single one.

For detailed information on this and the full *Supplication of Infinite Blessings* in both (English + Arabic) visit: https://www.duasharing.com/

I make duʿāʾ that Allah accepts it from you, and reward you for all those it reaches through you.

*Ameen.*`;
